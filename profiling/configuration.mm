#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# For assignment 2, you will be using an r-VEX core. The r-VEX does not support
# as many different configurations as the HP VEX compiler; this file lists the
# (few) things that you can vary. (Note: some of the things below here can
# actually be varied in the core. The instruction latencies are one of these
# things, as the r-VEX has a configurable pipeline. The toolchain is not
# sufficiently developed to modify these things as easily as the other things
# though.)

# The r-VEX can be configured to have an issue width of 2, 4, or 8. Each issue
# slot has an ALU, so the number of ALUs must be set to the issue width.
RES: IssueWidth     2
RES: IssueWidth.0   2
RES: Alu.0          2

# The number of multipliers. This can be freely configured between 1 and the
# issue width.
RES: Mpy.0          2
