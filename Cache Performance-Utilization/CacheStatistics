General Conclusions from below: Compress has most number of calls to dcache and icache contrary to what we would expect. I think our pareto will be with either both 2k or both 4k. Having different values for icache and dcache size doesnt make any sense. 

Look at the gmon-*.txt for details on cache performance for each benchmark. 


Cache Performance/Utilization 

BCNT 

Loads: 390
Stores: 2

40 calls to icache. 19% spent on __vex_main, 12% on __sfvwrite

38 calls to dcache. 33% spent on __vex_main

Conclusion: Low icache and dcache pressure from this benchmark



Median

Loads: 38716
Stores: 4303

36 calls to dcache. 99% spent on __vex_main
36 calls to icache. 99% spent on __vex_main

Conclusion: higher number of load/store operations but calls to icache and dcache are not very large.


Compress
Loads: 29011
Stores: 20873

971 calls to dcache. 28% spent on compressf, 19% spent on decompress, 18% spent on compressgetcode

971 calls to icache. 30% spent on compressf, 21% on decompress, 20% on compressgetcode

Conclusion: Large number of load/store ops and relatively large number of calls to dcache and icache, so higher pressure on them. 



Convlusion: 
Loads: 376770
Stores: 7462

35 calls to dcache. 93% spent on __vex_main. Same statistic for icache. 


Conclusion: Has a large number of loads but not a lot of stores. And weirdly not a lot of calls to either cache. Low pressure on cache looking at these results but im not convinced.
