INFO:Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram_requesting[1]_GND_926_o_wide_mux_3_OUT<0>> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 7-bit shift register was found for signal <ddr3ctrl/u_memc_ui_top/u_mem_intfc/phy_top0/u_phy_write/rst_delayed_7> and currently occupies 7 logic cells (3 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 5-bit shift register was found for signal <ddr3ctrl/u_memc_ui_top/u_mem_intfc/phy_top0/u_phy_read/u_phy_rdctrl_sync/rdpath_rdy_dly_r_9> and currently occupies 5 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 15-bit shift register was found for signal <ddr3ctrl/u_iodelay_ctrl/rst_ref_sync_r_14> and currently occupies 15 logic cells (7 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices).
